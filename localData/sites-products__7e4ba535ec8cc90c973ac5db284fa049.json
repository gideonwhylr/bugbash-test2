	"richTextDescription": "Gucci's AW20 collection is inspired by Mr Alessandro Micheleâ€™s childhood and includes tailored shorts that take their cue from school uniforms - at the show they were styled with shrunken blazers and knee-high socks. This pair is tailored from grey wool-flannel and pleated at the waistband to enhance the wide-leg shape. Use the side adjusters to personalise the fit."
